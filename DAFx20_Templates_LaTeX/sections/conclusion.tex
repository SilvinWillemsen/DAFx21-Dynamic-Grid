\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper presents a method to dynamically change grids of finite difference schemes


The proposed method might not provide the exact solution to the problem, but does circumvent the need for upsampling and higher orders of computations necessary to approximate this solution. Even though interpolation needs to happen, the drawbacks of full-grid interpolation can be avoided by not `listening' to the location where points are added but rather closer to the boundary. If one wants to listen to the center, the location where points are added or removed can easily be changed.

The 1D wave equation is used as a test case, but the method could be used for other systems as well. 


Future work includes creating an adaptive version of the displacement correction that changes its effect depending on the speed at which the grid is changed.
